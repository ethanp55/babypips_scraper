NOTE: THIS WEB SCRAPER WORKS AS OF JULY 2022; IT IS POSSIBLE THAT BABYPIPS CHANGED THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR ECONOMIC CALENDAR WEBPAGE

This is a basic web scraper to pull information from the economic calendar found on the babypips website (https://www.babypips.com/economic-calendar).  Please note that, for my purposes, I only extracted about half of the event features (i.e. I pull the date, currency code, etc. as found on lines 34-40 of scraper.py); you can alter the code to extract what you need, though if you need additional features you will need to look at the json returned from babypips.  Additionally, I created the script to either pull the most recent week of data, or to pull data from a specified year range.  Again, this was done to meet my purposes, but you can change it as needed.  Finally, I store the data as a pandas dataframe, though you could definitely store the events as other objects, store them in a databased, etc.
